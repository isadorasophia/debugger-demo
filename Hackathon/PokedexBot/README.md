This sample demonstrates the use of rich content using cards.
# Concepts introduced in this sample
## What is a bot?
A bot is an app that users interact with in a conversational way using text, graphics (cards), or speech. It may be a simple question and answer dialog,
or a sophisticated bot that allows people to interact with services in an intelligent manner using pattern matching,
state tracking and artificial intelligence techniques well-integrated with existing business services.
## Rich Cards
Most channels support rich content.  In this sample we explore the different types of rich cards your bot may use.
# To try this sample
- Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
```
- [Optional] Update the `appsettings.json` file under `botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/06.using-cards` with your botFileSecret.  For Azure Bot Service bots, you can find the botFileSecret under application settings.

# Running Locally
## Visual Studio
- Navigate to the samples folder (`botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/06.using-cards`) and open CardsBot.csproj in Visual Studio
- Run the project (press `F5` key)

## .NET Core CLI
- Install the [.NET Core CLI tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/?tabs=netcore2x).
- Using the command line, navigate to `botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/06.using-cards`
- Type `dotnet run`.

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot
developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.
- Install the [Bot Framework emulator](https://aka.ms/botframeworkemulator).

## Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator **V4**
- Launch the Bot Framework Emulator.
- File -> Open bot and navigate to `botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/06.using-cards` folder.
- Select `using-cards.bot` file.
# Deploy this bot to Azure
You can use the [MSBot](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools) Bot Builder CLI tool to clone and configure any services this sample depends on. In order to install this and other tools, you can read [Installing CLI Tools](../../../Installing_CLI_tools.md).

To clone this bot, run
```
msbot clone services -f deploymentScripts/msbotClone -n <BOT-NAME> -l <Azure-location> --subscriptionId <Azure-subscription-id> --appId <YOUR APP ID> --appSecret <YOUR APP SECRET PASSWORD>
```

**NOTE**: You can obtain your `appId` and `appSecret` at the Microsoft's [Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/)
